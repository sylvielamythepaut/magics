 \section intro What is Magics++?

 Magics++ is the second generation of a meteorological graphics 
 library developed at the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int"><i>European 
 Centre for Medium Range Forecasts (ECMWF)</i></a>. This library is 
 developed in C++ and offers output in various formats such as PostScript, 
 PDF, PNG, SVG, KML and Qt. 

 \section install How-to install

 Before installation you have to compile Magics++. To do so, simply 
 unpack the tarball in an appropiate directory and run <i>./configure</i> 
 followed by <i>make</i>. You can type <i>./configure --help</i> to get all
 options of configuring Magics++. 
 
 To install type <i>make install</i>. Depending on the 
 choosen installation directory you need root permission.

 For more information you should read the <a href="">installation guide</a>.

 \section interfaces Magics interfaces

 Magics++ offers different interfaces to access its graphics 
 functionality: C++ (for higher-level applicatiosn such as Metview), C, Fortran 77
 Python and MagML/MagJson. The Fortran interface is intended to be backwards compatible with older 
 versions (mainly the the 6.x series) of Magics.
